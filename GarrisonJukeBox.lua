	Known Bugs/Issues
	-------------------------
	- The alignment of text in the selected sample music is aligned to the right but should be left. This is caused by Ace3 GUI; not a bug.
	- Sometimes when changing from a zone not on the zonelist to a zone that is, GJB will play 2 consecutive songs. Possibly fixed but needs additional testing. FIXED!
	- Enable/Disable checkbox in settings for the addon seems not to function properly.
